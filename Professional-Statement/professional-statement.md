# Professional Statement

I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in problem-solving,
time management, and risk awareness developed through entrepreneurship and operational
leadership. My interest in cybersecurity is driven by the critical role it plays in
protecting organizations, sensitive data, and the people who rely on secure systems.

I value ethical responsibility, accountability, and proactive security practices, and I am
committed to continuously developing my technical skills to identify vulnerabilities,
mitigate risks, and support organizational security goals. My background as a business
owner has given me a practical understanding of how security incidents can disrupt
operations and impact trust.

As I progress in my cybersecurity education, I aim to contribute to security teams that
prioritize prevention, compliance, and responsible data protection while continuously
improving their security posture in an evolving threat landscape.
